% Modified 1-May-1990 Don Hosek to allow it to work properly when input

%One continual annoyance to me is that LaTeX does absolute font sizing,
%and so if you have some \newcommand that uses the sizing commands to
%achieve some graphic effect, you'll discover that your chapter heads
%and footnotes and such are pretty screwed up [in a recent case, I
%wanted a fake small-caps-san-serif font, and so I used {\small\sf
%NOWISTHETIME}, which did just what I wanted in the running text, but
%was an unmitigated disaster in the chapter heads].  I think that the
%following is a significant improvement: \smaller and \larger changes
%the point size *relatively* by one slot, and so I made my definition:
%{\smaller\sf NOWISTHETIME}, and it all magically works.  The
%definitions are:

\def\smaller{\ifx\@currsize\Huge\huge \else
              \ifx\@currsize\huge\LARGE \else
               \ifx\@currsize\LARGE\Large \else
                \ifx\@currsize\Large\large \else
                 \ifx\@currsize\large\normalsize \else
                  \ifx\@currsize\normalsize\small \else
                   \ifx\@currsize\small\footnotesize \else
                    \ifx\@currsize\footnotesize\scriptsize \else
                       \protect\tiny
                    \fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi}

\def\larger{\ifx\@currsize\tiny\scriptsize \else
              \ifx\@currsize\scriptsize\footnotesize \else
               \ifx\@currsize\footnotesize\small \else
                \ifx\@currsize\small\normalsize \else
                 \ifx\@currsize\normalsize\large \else
                  \ifx\@currsize\large\Large \else
                   \ifx\@currsize\Large\LARGE \else
                    \ifx\@currsize\LARGE\huge \else
                       \Huge
                    \fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi}
