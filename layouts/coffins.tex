Frank Mittelbach in this answer said: "I would be interested who would attempt to do that in the plain TeX box model approach. Here is my approach which I will from now onwards call it for simplicity, the pauper's coffins approach". 

If one removes all the `fbox`, the `scalebox ` and the first `vbox` that is used in order to make the `scalebox` work, properly. I am also sure that the code can be reduced to a one line statement and here is my question: Can you produce this layout with a one line statement?.
