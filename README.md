# Minimum Working Examples #

This is a collection of MWE examples, using (La)TeX. 
I intend to summarize them when all of them are polished 
and updated. At the moment I will be uploading 3-5 daily, 
as I got stacks of them. Once they are all uploaded I will 
provide a guide. They are mostly aimed at people wishing to 
program in TeX, rather than just use it for a document or 
thesis.
