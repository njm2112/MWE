Your suggestion that the code is longer than html/css/javascript is doubtful. I understand you coming from float:right, but you forgot all about having to clear divs etc. When he actually based a lot of his research on TeX. Like learning anew language you need to spend a bit of time to develop your style and base knowledge. And the almost impossible way to vertically center elements in html/css.
